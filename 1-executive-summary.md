# 1 Executive Summary

The training needs of Open Access Journal editors, reviewers, Institutional Publishing Service Providers (IPSPs) and Institutional Publishing Technical Providers (IPTPs) are as diverse as the technical standards they are confronted with. The deliverable “D2.2 Reusable curriculum for upskilling trainings” provides a modular framework for upskilling qualification in technical topics and takes into account the variety of publishing environments in which they occur. In addition to suggesting the training topics, the deliverable elaborates on their contents, presents existing training materials and provides practical recommendations for organising and structuring a training. To each training topic a potential target audience, a user level and a FAIR principle is assigned. A succinct information on training topics is presented in the curriculum checklist, which can be used as a backbone of the upskilling agenda. The curriculum is thus designed to be adapted to the context and to the mode of the training.
