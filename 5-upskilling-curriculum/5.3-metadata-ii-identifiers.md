# 5.3 Metadata II: identifiers

**5.3.1 Suggested training topics**

1. Introduction to identifiers: IDs, PIDs and metadata standards
2. Identifier systems
   1. Resource identifiers (ISSN/eISSN, DOI, Handle, ARK)
   2. Organisation identifiers (Funder ID, ROR ID)
   3. Contributor identifiers (ORCID, VIAF)

**5.3.2 Notes on the training topics**

This curriculum singles out identifiers as a separate block within the general metadata realm covered in the previous chapter (§5.2). The importance of IDs for the findability of the resorces was highlighted in CRAFT-OA D3.2 (Laakso et al. 2024). The GoTriple Handbook draws the following distinction between IDs and PIDs:

_Identifiers are non semantic strings of characters uniquely identifying a resource. They should belong to a well-known identification system (e.g. ISBN, DOI, handle.net, etc.). In the digital context, the more important identifier is the Persistent Identifier (PID), which ensures the identification of the resource throughout the various digital locations. Persistent Priority Description Hints and comments identifiers include among others: DOI from Datacite or Crossref, handles from handle._[_net_](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]_._

The training block on identifiers is split into two parts:

* The “Introduction to identifiers” draws a distinction between IDs and their digital pendants PIDs and aims at providing an overview of the most common identification systems (ISSN, DOI, ORCID, ROR, Funder DOIs / PIDs, etc.). In addition, it contains explanations on how identifiers are expressed in established metadata standards on journal and the article level:
  * Dublin Core (simple and qualified)
  * MARC family (MARC21 and MARC XML)
  * MODS XML
  * ONIX XML
  * JATS XML and TEI XMl header
  * KBART files
  * OpenAire guidelines
  * Europeana Data model
* The section on “Identifier systems” is intended to focus on the particular identifier types. They are thematically split into three groups: resource, organisation and contributor identifiers. The section covers, for instance, the administrative procedures for obtaining an ISSN; the process of adding DOIs for new articles (involving an initial setup and configuration of software plugins, minting new DOIs and data transfer to the registration institution); the recommendations on obtaining ORCID IDs for researchers, ROR IDs for the research performing organisations and funder DOIs/PIDs for the research supporting organisations. The training topics can also include the Archival Resource Key (ARK) and the Handle System.
