# 5.4  Metadata III: licensing, OA and self-archiving policy

5.4.1 Suggested training topics

1. Introduction to open access models and licence types
   1. Green, Gold and Diamond OA
   2. Creative Commons, MIT licence, GNU
2. Journal’s self-archiving policy
3. Setting up the publishing system:
   1. Licences and self-archiving policy in metadata.
   2. Licences and self-archiving policy in content data (XML, HTML, PDF).

**5.4.2 Notes on the training topics**

The second focus area singled out from the general “Metadata” complex is licensing, open access status and author’s self-archiving policy pertaining to both metadata and the contents of the publication. An introduction to the Open Access models and common licence types opens up this block. The former covers the differences between Green, Gold and Diamond Open Access and highlights the importance of the Diamond model for the research communities. The latter explicates the differences between Creative Commons licences (explaining the attributes BY, ND, SA, NC), MIT licence and GNU General Public License, frequently used for datasets and software and thus relevant for the research data accompanying publications. Next, the description of the journal's self-archiving policy is detailed, i.e. the statement on the author’s rights to maintain a copy of different versions of the text (pre-print or author accepted manuscript - AAM). An introduction to the registrars of self-archiving policies such as Sherpa Romeo can be provided. These two sections serve as a theoretical foundation for a further training area, which describes how licensing and self-archiving policy is set up in a given publishing system.

“Report on challenges and help measures faced by Open Access journals and platforms” (CRAFT-OA Deliverable 3.2) specified that metadata should be available under CC0 licence to guarantee its accessibility and reusability. The section therefore starts with explaining how the licences and self-archiving policy are encoded in journals and articles' metadata. Subsequently, it clarifies how the statements on licences and self-archiving policy are rendered in content data. The latter includes HTML (journal homepage and article landing pages), PDF and XML with its common standards such as MARC, DC, ONIX, JATS, TEI.
